f1
ask for unit name

f2
initialize integer array
ask for 25 student marks

if mark input is between 0 and 100
	accept input
else
	reject input and ask again
	f3
	print error message

f4
print unit name
initialize highest with zero
initialize lowest with zero
initialize total with zero
loop 25 student marks
	while looping print student mark
	while looping add student marks for total
	while looping compare highest value to current value
	while looping compare lowest value to current value

f5
print lowest
print highest

f6
initialize standard deviation with zero
compute for mean
loop 25 student marks
	while looping add the square the difference of number and mean to standard deviation
